📚 InfraWatchX – Intelligent AI-Based Classroom Monitoring System

An end-to-end AI system for automated attendance, student engagement analysis, and classroom safety monitoring using modular computer vision and cloud-ready architecture.

🧠 Overview

InfraWatchX is a modular AI-based classroom monitoring system designed to assist educational institutions in:

Automating attendance

Analyzing student engagement (focus & emotions)

Detecting safety-related events (crowding, fights, prohibited objects)

Unlike single-model or rule-based solutions, InfraWatchX follows a multi-model decision-fusion architecture, where each AI model is responsible for a specific task and their outputs are aggregated by an Administrative Decision Engine.

This project focuses on AI system engineering, scalability, and real-world deployability, making it suitable for final-year academic evaluation and industry demonstration.

⚖️ Ethical Considerations

No biometric data permanently stored

No facial images saved after inference

System acts as decision-support, not surveillance

No psychological profiling

Designed for academic & administrative assistance only

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is developed strictly for academic and research purposes.
